## Week 1

High level summary of what has been covered in each session.

### Day 1: QUBITS & QUANTUM STATES, CIRCUITS, MEASUREMENTS
Introduced the topic of Quantum Computing (QC) and highlighted the fundamental differences between QC and Classical Computing by focusing on the bits vs qubits and computational complexities. Dirac Notation was also introduced and basic operations of linear algebra - inner, outer, tensor products - were explained through the bra-ket notation. Concepts of measurement, Born rule and the bloch sphere were also touched upon. Quantum Circuits were later introduced and important gates (CNOT, Hadamard, Pauli) were explained. Multipartite quantum states and entagled states were breifly explained. Entaglement was explained in more details using Bell states, the lecture was concluded by walking through an instance of Quantum Teleportation and Q spheres.
